### Usage
- Provide a webhook, username, message, and amount (those fields are all required), or you can use the embed mode which only requires one field for it to send.
- You can also load multiple webhooks in any txt file containing webhooks, and it will automatically validate them.
- If multiple messages are sent at once discord will automatically ratelimit you, but there is a checkbox to delay spamming.
- And to finish it all off, you can delete/mass delete webhooks!
